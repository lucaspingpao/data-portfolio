# Lucas Pao's Data Portfolio

Welcome! My name is Lucas Pao and I am a recent graduate from Harvard with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I am actively seeking a full-time entry-level job in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, or any type of role that utilizes the combination of my strong coding skills and analytical mindset. I have taken a number of practical data courses such as [COMPSCI 181: Machine Learning](https://harvard-ml-courses.github.io/cs181-web-2022/) taught by Professor Finale Doshi-Velez and [ECON 50: Big Data for Social Good](https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Econ-50-Syllabus.pdf) taught by Professor Raj Chetty.

Listed below are a sample of data-related projects I have worked on throughout my early tech career and education, categorized by programming language/tool. Feel free to browse through my portfolio by clicking on the links below, which will redirect you to code samples, pdfs of reports, interactive Jupyter notebooks displaying graphical visualizations, external links to deployed dashboards, and more!

* Skills: text mining, regular expressions, optical character recognition

* Summary: summer internship (2021) focusing on extracting key data fields through conversion of pdfs and images of financial documents to structured formats


## R

### [Opportunity Atlas](/R%20projects/Opportunity%20Atlas/)

* Skills: regression analysis, correlation analysis, data visualization (ggplot)

* Summary: implemented regression and correlation analysis on neighborhood census data in Nashville, TN and predicted causal effects of redlining and home segregation policies on upward mobility outcomes

### [R/RShiny Curriculum](/R%20projects/R%20and%20RShiny%20Curriculum/)

* Skills: R, RShiny, data analysis, data visualization, curriculum development, teaching
