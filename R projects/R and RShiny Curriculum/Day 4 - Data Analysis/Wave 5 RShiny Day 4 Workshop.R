# Day 4 - Data Analysis
# Created by Lucas Pao on August 20, 2020

# 1. Creating Data Frames -------------------------------------------------

# a) Open up the file named “Wave 5 RShiny Day 4 Workshop.R” in RStudio.
# b) Introduce yourself to the other students in your breakout group (First name, grade, favorite ice cream flavor). Write this information in the script as a comment.
# You should collect 10 students’ information. If there are fewer than 10 students in your group, you can use a random number generator to create imaginary data.
# c) Create three vectors, each containing information about the students in your breakout group:
# one consisting of all the students’ names, one consisting of all the students’ grades, and one consisting of all the students’ favorite ice cream flavors.

# *** WRITE CODE for 1.c) HERE ***


# d) Combine these vectors into a dataframe, where each row represents different students’ information.
# Rename the row and column headers to reflect the information stored inside this dataframe.

# *** WRITE CODE for 1.d) HERE ***


# e) Print a list of everyone’s favorite ice cream flavor by accessing the corresponding information in the data frame using two different methods.
# f) Print your ice cream flavor by accessing it in the data frame.

# *** WRITE CODE for 1.e), 1.f) HERE ***


# g) Print a unique list of everyone’s favorite ice cream flavors.

# *** WRITE CODE for 1.g) HERE ***


# h) Create a new data frame of students who are in high school (9th grade or higher)
# Repeat questions e., f., and g. for this new subset of students.

# *** WRITE CODE for 1.h) HERE ***



# 2. Analyzing Covid Data -------------------------------------------------

# a) Download “Wave5-RShiny-Covid-Dataset.csv” and import the dataset into R. Make sure to set your working directory as your downloads folder or wherever your dataset is located.
# b) Preview the data using different commands to get a better sense of the data you will be analyzing.

# *** WRITE CODE for 2.a), b) HERE ***


# c) Pick your favorite country and analyze the following results for that country.
#   i. What is the total number of covid deaths in that country? 
#   ii. On how many days has that country reported more than 100 cases?
#   iii. What is the average number of deaths reported for days on which that country has reported more than 100 cases?
#   iv. Replace the existing data under “dateRep” with numbers representing the number of days after January 1, 2020. You can assume a month has 30 days in this case.
#   v. How many days after January 1, 2020, did that country first report over 100 cases in one day?

# *** WRITE CODE for 2.c) HERE ***


# d) Ask 3 questions about this data and try to come up with some interesting results!

# *** WRITE CODE for 2.d) HERE ***
