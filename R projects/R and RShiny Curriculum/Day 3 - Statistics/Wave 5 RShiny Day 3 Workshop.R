# 1. Creating your Data Set ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# a) Collect everyone’s ages and put them in a vector called “ages”.
# b) Using the sample() function in R, generate 5 random numbers between 1 and 10, and put these numbers into a vector called “random”.

# *** WRITE CODE for 1.a), 1.b) HERE ***



# 2. Practicing Central Tendencies - do by hand first, then check your work in R. -----------------------------------------------

# a) Find the mean of the sets of numbers in “ages” and in “random” by hand.
# b) Find the median of the sets of numbers in “ages” and in “random” by hand.
# c) Check your answers by running the appropriate commands in R.

# *** WRITE CODE for 2.c) HERE ***


# d) (Bonus!) Write your own function that takes a vector of numbers and outputs the mode of the set of numbers.
# Note: the existing “mode” function in the base package of R does something completely different than expected!

# *** WRITE CODE for 2.d) HERE ***


# e) Find the mode of the sets of numbers in “ages” and in “random” by hand
# Check your work using the new “mode” function you wrote in part d).

# *** WRITE CODE for 2.e) HERE ***



# 3. Practicing Measures of Spread - no need to do by hand first, just calculate directly in R. -----------------------------------------------
# a) Find the min, max, and range of the sets of numbers in “ages” and in “random”.
# b) Find the 25th and 75th percentile of the sets of numbers in “ages” and in “random”.
# c) Find the interquartile range of the sets of numbers in “ages” and in “random”.
# d) Find the variance of the sets of numbers in “ages” and in “random”.
# e) Find the standard deviation of the sets of numbers in “ages” and in “random”.
